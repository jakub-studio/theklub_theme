# Theme for The Klub
<sup>this used to be a gist, however I moved it here so it auto updoots because RawGit keeps you locked to a certain commit when using gists.</sup>

To use this get a extension such as [Stylus for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en) or [Stylish for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/stylish/) and add this line of code:

`@import url('https://rawgit.com/jakuski/theklub_theme/master/theme.css');`
